Working ->

This code finds the maximum possible value that can be obtained by multiplying three integers from an input array of integers. Here is how it works:

1. The code first prompts the user to enter the size of the array they want to input.

```bash
    int n;
    printf("Enter the size -> ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

```

2. It then creates an integer array of size n and prompts the user to input n integers to fill the array.

```bash
    int a[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf ("Enter the numbers -> ");
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    }

```

3. The code then initializes five integer variables with values of INT_MAX and INT_MIN, which represent the minimum and maximum values that an integer can hold in C. These variables are used to find the largest and smallest integers in the array.


```bash
    int max1 = INT_MIN, max2 = INT_MIN, max3 = INT_MIN;
    int min1 = INT_MAX, min2 = INT_MAX;
```

4. The code then loops through the array and updates the maximum and minimum values as it goes along. Specifically, it uses conditional statements to determine whether each element in the array is greater than or less than the previously recorded maximum or minimum values. If an element is greater than max1, it becomes the new maximum value, and the previous maximum values are shifted down accordingly. If an element is less than min1, it becomes the new minimum value, and the previous minimum values are shifted down accordingly.

```bash
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] > max1) {
            max3 = max2;
            max2 = max1;
            max1 = a[i];
        } else if (a[i] > max2) {
            max3 = max2;
            max2 = a[i];
        } else if (a[i] > max3) {
            max3 = a[i];
        }
        
        if (a[i] < min1) {
            min2 = min1;
            min1 = a[i];
        } else if (a[i] < min2) {
            min2 = a[i];
        }
    }
```

5. The code then calculates two potential results for the maximum possible value: result and temp. result is calculated by multiplying the two largest integers and the largest integer among the three largest integers found in step 4. temp is calculated by multiplying the largest and smallest integers and the second smallest integer found in step 4. The code then checks whether temp is greater than result, and if it is, result is updated to equal temp.

```bash
    int result = (max1 - max2) * max3;
    int temp = (max1 - min1) * min2;
    if (temp > result) {
        result = temp;
    }
```

6. Finally, the code outputs the result.

```bash
    printf("The max element is -> %d\n", result);
    
    return 0;
}
```
