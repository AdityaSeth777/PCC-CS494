This program implements binary search algorithm in C language. Binary search is a searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It starts by dividing the array into two halves and then checks whether the middle element is the target element, if it is, then the search is complete. If the middle element is greater than the target element, then the left half is searched. If the middle element is smaller than the target element, then the right half is searched. This process is repeated until the target element is found or the array is exhausted.

The binary_search function takes four arguments - arr which is the sorted array, left and right which are the indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements respectively, and x which is the target element to search for. The function first checks whether the search is complete, i.e., left > right, and returns -1 if the element is not found. Otherwise, it calculates the mid index as (left + right) / 2 and checks whether the middle element is the target element. If it is, then it returns the mid index. If the middle element is greater than the target element, then the left half is searched by calling the binary_search function recursively with updated left and right indices. If the middle element is smaller than the target element, then the right half is searched by calling the binary_search function recursively with updated left and right indices.

The main function first asks the user to enter the size of the array and the elements of the array in ascending order. Then it asks the user to enter the target element to search for. It calls the binary_search function with initial left and right indices as 0 and n - 1 respectively, where n is the size of the array. It stores the returned index in the result variable. If the result is -1, then the element is not found, and it prints "Element not found". Otherwise, it prints "Element found at index ```<result>```" where ```<result>``` is the index of the target element in the array. Finally, it returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.
