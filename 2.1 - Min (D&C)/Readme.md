This code is an implementation of the Divide and Conquer algorithm to find the minimum and maximum element in an array of integers. The program prompts the user to enter the size of the array and then reads in the elements of the array. The findMinMax function is called with the array, starting index (low), and ending index (high) as parameters, and the function uses the divide and conquer technique to recursively divide the array into smaller sub-arrays until each sub-array contains only one element, then returns the minimum and maximum elements of the sub-array. The minimum and maximum elements of the sub-arrays are then merged using the maximum and minimum functions to return the minimum and maximum elements of the entire array.

```bash
int maximum(int a, int b) {
    return (a > b) ? a : b;
}

int minimum(int a, int b) {
    return (a < b) ? a : b;
}
```
These are two simple functions that take in two integer parameters and return the maximum and minimum of the two values, respectively. These functions are used later in the findMinMax function to determine the maximum and minimum of two sub-arrays.


Now,
```bash
void findMinMax(int arr[], int low, int high, int *max, int *min) {
    int mid, max1, max2, min1, min2;

    // base case: if there are only two elements in the array
    if (high - low == 1) {
        if (arr[low] > arr[high]) {
            *max = arr[low];
            *min = arr[high];
        } else {
            *max = arr[high];
            *min = arr[low];
        }
    }
    // base case: if there is only one element in the array
    else if (high - low == 0) {
        *max = arr[low];
        *min = arr[low];
    }
    // recursive case: split the array into two sub-arrays and recursively call the function
    else {
        mid = (low + high) / 2;
        findMinMax(arr, low, mid, &max1, &min1);
        findMinMax(arr, mid + 1, high, &max2, &min2);
        *max = maximum(max1, max2);
        *min = minimum(min1, min2);
    }
}
```

This function takes in four parameters: an integer array, the low and high indices of the array, and two integer pointers to hold the maximum and minimum values. It recursively finds the maximum and minimum values of the array by splitting the array into sub-arrays until the base case is reached.

In the base case, if there are only two elements in the array, the function compares the two elements and sets the maximum and minimum values accordingly.

If there is only one element in the array, the function sets the maximum and minimum values to the same value.

In the recursive case, the function splits the array into two sub-arrays, calls itself recursively on each sub-array, and then sets the maximum and minimum values of the original array to the maximum and minimum values of the two sub-arrays.
