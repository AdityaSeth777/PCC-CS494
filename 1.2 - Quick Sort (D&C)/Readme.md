The Quick Sort algorithm is a popular sorting algorithm that uses the Divide and Conquer approach. It works by partitioning the array into two sub-arrays around a pivot element, such that all elements in the left sub-array are smaller than the pivot, and all elements in the right sub-array are greater than the pivot. The pivot element is then placed in its correct position in the final sorted array. This process is repeated recursively for each sub-array until the entire array is sorted.

The implementation begins with the main function, which prompts the user to enter the size of the array and the elements of the array. The quickSort function is then called to sort the array.

The quickSort function takes three arguments: the array to be sorted (arr), and the indices for the lowest and highest elements of the sub-array to be sorted (low and high respectively). The base case for the recursive function is when low is greater than or equal to high, which means the sub-array contains zero or one elements and is already sorted.

The partition function is called from quickSort to partition the sub-array around a pivot element. The partition function takes three arguments: the array to be partitioned (arr), and the indices for the lowest and highest elements of the sub-array to be partitioned (low and high respectively). The pivot element is chosen as the last element of the sub-array (arr[high]), and two counters i and j are initialized to low-1 and low respectively.

The j counter scans through the array from low to high-1. If the current element is smaller than the pivot, it is swapped with the element at arr[i+1] (which is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to the pivot) and the i counter is incremented. This ensures that all elements smaller than the pivot are to the left of i, and all elements greater than or equal to the pivot are to the right of i.

Once all elements have been scanned, the pivot is swapped with the element at arr[i+1], which places the pivot in its correct position in the final sorted array. The partition function then returns the index of the pivot element.

Back in quickSort, the indices for the left and right sub-arrays are calculated based on the index of the pivot element returned by partition. The quickSort function is then called recursively for each sub-array, until the entire array is sorted.

Finally, the sorted array is printed using a for loop in main.

Overall, the Quick Sort algorithm has an average case time complexity of O(n log n), which makes it a very efficient sorting algorithm for large arrays. However, in the worst case (when the pivot element is the smallest or largest element in the sub-array), the time complexity can be O(n^2), which can make it inefficient for certain use cases.
